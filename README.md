# GrammaTag

GrammaTag is an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on text analysis tasks such as:

- **Text Extraction and Relationship Mapping**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**

## Features
- **Text Extraction**: Identify and map relationships between key phrases in text.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Detect entities such as names, locations, and organizations.
- **POS Tagging**: Annotate text with part-of-speech labels for linguistic analysis.
